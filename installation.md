 2. Copy them to a folder on your web server, assuming that you know how to configure your server to run Perl CGI scripts.  
 3. Change the $xml_path and $xml_link values in qconverter_handler.cgi for the location where the output xml file is saved on your server and the link to download this xml file via web browser
 4. The form can be accessed at http://<your_server_name>/<cgi_path>/qconverter.cgi
